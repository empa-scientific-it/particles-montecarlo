# particles-montecarlo

This C++ code performs a simulation to evaluate the infection risk of respiratory viral infections in space and time using a stochastic Lagrangian approach. It integrates fluid dynamical and biological aspects of disease transmission to approximate a representative average interaction indoors and outdoors. The code provides spatiotemporal concentration maps of particles exhaled during different respiratory events under various environmental conditions.

Folders:

- `cpp`: the main C++ code
- `python`: Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks
- `extras`: additional material

The project's documentation will be hosted in the Wiki of the repository.
